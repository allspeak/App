NEW RELEASE : versionCode="8", versionName="0.2.1"

# training
NEW FEATURE: semplified training management. in training page: pureuser e common adapted are in two separate cards. each card has a NEW and an UPDATE button...complexity is hidden
in VocabularyCtrl e RecognitionCtrl I show only UTENTE o COMUNE ADATTATA regardless of the actual used subtype.

# reset nets when:
NEW FEATURE: when I modify the command list => it asks whether deleting ALL the trained nets (but also suggests to create a new voc as a copy)
NEW FEATURE: when I delete a custom command => it remove such command from all the voc containing it and deletes ALL their trained nets
NEW FEATURE: when I recreate a PU or CA     => delete PUA, PURA e CRA


# connection
NEW FEATURE: disable training button when at least one repetition of each command is present...make manage recordings button in violet to stress it.
INITCHECK:   separation between no connection (alert and go directly to home) & server down.
NEW FEATURE: disable training buttons when get disconnected from internet, automatically move from training => vocabulary
NEW FEATURE: App update can be postponed.

NEW FEATURE: may create a new vocabulary copying the commands' list from an existing one

NEW FEATURE: when I delete the selected voc, I select the default one.

NEW FEATURE: during training. cancel buttons stop everything...
concerning features extraction: now the web layer call the plugin processFile and not processFolder...so when cancel is pressed, it waits for the completion of the ongoing file and then stops


BUG FIX: in RecognitionCtrl 
 - corrected fRecognitionThreshold
 - corrected switch among net
 - select a net only if is not a testing one.
